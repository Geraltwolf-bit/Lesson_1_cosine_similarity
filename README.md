# Lesson_1_cosine_similarity
In this program, I demostrate the use of cosine similarity in finding 5 most similar and dissimilar items to the item with the index 0
Firts, I generate dataframe 100, 10.
Then I take a general look at the data
Before calulculating cosine similarity, where -1 is dissimilar and 1 is similar, I preprocess the data.
To preprocess the data I find if it's normally distributed or skewed. I find that it's mostly normal.
I preprocess the data with StandardScaler and apply cosine similarity.
I print the result.
